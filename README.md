# Introduction 

A sample repository to learn how to use pull requests on Github.

### Submitting Pull Requests as evidence of an LO

1. Fork the repo to your personal GitHub account, if you haven't done so already.

2. Create a branch named after the LO ID e.g. W2.2b. Remember to switch to master branch before creating the new branch.

3. Commit your changes to that branch. Push to your fork.

4. Create a Pull Request against the master branch of the repo `https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S2/{repo_name}` e.g. `https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S2/addressbook-level1` 
(do not create PRs against the upstream repo at se-edu org). The PR name should be: `[LO_ID][TEAM_ID]Your Name`

5. Check the 'Files Changed' tab on GitHub to confirm the PR contains intended changes only.

6. If the content of the PR is not as you expected, you can fix those problems in your local repo, commit, and push those new commits to the fork. The PR content will update automatically to match new commits. Alternatively, you can close that PR and create a new one with the correct content.

7. If your PR adapted/referred code from elsewhere (e.g. a StackOverflow post or a classmate's PR - which is allowed, even encouraged), acknowledge the source in your PR description text. 
e.g. Some code adapted from #2431 (I followed the same technique for parsing user command)

8. If the PR is not ready for review yet, add a comment 'Work in progress'. When the PR is ready for review later, add a comment 'Ready for review' If there is no comment, we assume the PR is ready for review.
